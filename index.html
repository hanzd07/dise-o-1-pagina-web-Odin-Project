            <img src="./Imagenes/Mountains.jpg" alt="Mountains_Landscape" height="400px" width="300px">
            <p>Mountains are formed through geological processes such as tectonic uplift, volcanic activity, and erosion. 
                The movements of tectonic plates are one of the main causes of mountain formation.</p>

            <img src="./Imagenes/Flower.jpg" alt="Sunflower" height="400px" width="300px">
            <p>Sunflowers are native to North America and were domesticated by indigenous peoples thousands of years ago. 
                Today, they are cultivated worldwide. A notable characteristic of young sunflowers is their ability to follow the movement of the sun throughout the day, 
                a phenomenon known as heliotropism.</p>

            <div class="Snowy">
            <img src="./Imagenes/Snowy.jpg" alt="Snowy_Mountains" height="400px" width="300px">
            <p>Snow-capped mountains are typically found at high altitudes where the temperature is low enough to maintain snow and ice year-round.</p>

            <div class="Waterfalls">
            <img src="./Imagenes/waterfall.jpg" alt="Waterfall" height="400px" width="300px">
            <p>Waterfalls are formed when a river or stream flows over a layer of hard rock that is situated over a layer of soft rock. Over time, 
                the soft rock erodes more quickly, creating a drop and, eventually, a waterfall.</p>
